; Brief description of the program
;   The LED toggles at 8 Hz and a varying duty-cycle
; Hardware connections (External: One button and one LED)
;  PE1 is Button input  (1 means pressed, 0 means not pressed)
;  PE0 is LED output (1 activates external LED on protoboard)
;  PF4 is builtin button SW1 on Launchpad (Internal) 
;        Negative Logic (0 means pressed, 1 means not pressed)
; Overall functionality of this system is to operate like this
;   1) Make PE0 an output and make PE1 and PF4 inputs.
;   2) The system starts with the the LED toggling at 8Hz,
;      which is 8 times per second with a duty-cycle of 20%.
;      Therefore, the LED is ON for (0.2*1/8)th of a second
;      and OFF for (0.8*1/8)th of a second.
;   3) When the button on (PE1) is pressed-and-released increase
;      the duty cycle by 20% (modulo 100%). Therefore for each
;      press-and-release the duty cycle changes from 20% to 40% to 60%
;      to 80% to 100%(ON) to 0%(Off) to 20% to 40% so on
;   4) Implement a "breathing LED" when SW1 (PF4) on the Launchpad is pressed:
;      a) Be creative and play around with what "breathing" means.
;         An example of "breathing" is most computers power LED in sleep mode
;         (e.g., https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZT6siXyIjvQ).
;      b) When (PF4) is released while in breathing mode, resume blinking at 8Hz.
;         The duty cycle can either match the most recent duty-
;         cycle or reset to 20%.
